Hello everyone!, I am a passionate frontend and mobile developer with experience in the most popular technologies. I've had the privilege of working at two Latin American unicorns, where I applied my skills in React and React Native to create stunning and functional user interfaces.

In addition to my experience in Latin America, I've also had the opportunity to work at American companies, which has given me a global perspective and the ability to adapt to different work environments. Throughout my professional journey, I have worked with a wide range of technologies such as React, React Native, JavaScript, Node.js, Sass, CSS, Next.js, and Nest.js.

In addition to my proficiency in these technologies, I am also comfortable working in multicultural and bilingual teams, thanks to my professional fluency in both English and Spanish.

I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to continue growing in the world of frontend and mobile development. I am excited to share my experiences and knowledge with all of you. Thank you!
